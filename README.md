## Project Overview

This project utilizes fundamental logic gates — AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, and NOR — to model conditional control for smart office functionalities. Entirely simulated on **Tinkercad Circuits**, it showcases how logic gate combinations can be used to control devices based on multiple inputs.

---

## Features

* Automatic lighting control based on specified conditions
* Fan activation logic circuits
* Security alert simulations using combinational gate logic
* Emergency handling through dedicated logic modules
* Truth table-driven decision processes for verification

---

## Simulation Platform

All circuits are developed and tested on **[Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/)** by Autodesk — a free, accessible web-based electronics simulator.

---

## Circuit Diagrams and Truth Tables

Detailed circuit diagrams, input/output truth tables, and descriptions of various scenarios are provided in the accompanying slide presentation/documentation.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a free account on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).
2. Access the public projects via the shared links below or search for **“Smart Office Electronics”**.
3. Run simulations with virtual switches as inputs and LEDs/buzzers as outputs.
4. Cross-reference results with truth tables to validate circuit behavior.
